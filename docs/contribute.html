<p>
This isn't really a roadmap, it is more of a list of signs pointing in the
right direction.
</p>

<p>
There are various tracks that can be followed to improve the future of GEGL in
GIMP, many of these things, at least on the GEGL side are covered by bugs in
bugzilla, properly git formatted patches adressing these issues are most
welcome contributions. Doing things on this list would help speed up the
arrival of the next and more powerful generation of GIMP.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a name='1'>Improve GIMP/GEGL integration</a>
  <ul>
  <li>Allow loading UI plug-ins for GIMP that provide custom UIs for GEGL ops.
    Such custom UI-s could first act like modal dialogs similar to the current
    GIMP plug-ins and later be the property panes of non destructive
    layer/effects or otherwise modifiable actions.
  </li><li>Make the GEGL tool register menu entries in filters.
   <li>Make single image raster import/export in GIMP use GEGL, perhaps also create a new improved templated with preview "export for web" workflow in GIMP based on GEGL</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name='2'>Improve GEGL</a>
  <ul>
  <li>GEGL already provides a lot of GIMPs core functionality; as well as many
    plug-ins. Some of this functionality is currently implemented as ops inside
    gimp. Porting more plug-ins and implementing infrastructure to be able to
    do more core functionality will benefit GIMP as the migration to GEGL goes
    forward.
  </li><li>Allow GEGL to run untrusted ops out-of process - ensuring that badly behaved
    ops will not bring GIMP/GEGL down.
   </li>
<!--<li>rewrite RAW loader to use <a href="http://www.libraw.org/">LibRaw</a> or <a 
                    href="http://sh0dan.blogspot.com/2009/02/introducing-rawspeed.html">Rawspeed</a> 
                    library instead of the abandoned libopenraw</li>-->
   <li>Implement COW of tiles for gegl_buffer_copy and gegl_buffer_dup</li>
   <li>Implement previews working on mipmap levels, allowing GEGL to do a preview at 12.5%, 25% or 50% of actual size - rendering the full size view in the background or on demand.</li>
   <li>Finish GEGL side of GIMP/GEGL integration for rendering only the viewed
   part when zoomed in - allowing realtime tweaking and preview with on-canvas
   preview at 1:1 scale. (this involves accepting two regions to be rendered
   with priority or similar integration, the regions are already available in
   the GIMP code. - the need for this will go away once the nodes for ops
   being previewed are embedded in the layer graph)</li>
    <li>Allow GEGL to connect any property of ops as inputs/outputs in the graph, the infrastructure to do so
        is mostly already in place, but not properly exposed. For some uses, in particular for exposing more
        powerful meta-ops this would be very nice.</li>
        <li>Implement GeglBuffer's tile-swapper in separate thread, at the moment
        the main thread might be blocked by io when swapping tiles out, this
        is not neccesary.
        </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name='3'>Port GIMP plug-ins to GEGL ops</a>
  <ul>
   <li> Writing GEGL ops is simpler than writing GIMP plug-ins, plug-ins can support
    higher bit depth in the future. Floating point code is easier to write, less
    code is needed. You can get auto generated UI.
    Writing more GIMP legacy plug-ins only increases the future porting
    work-load/leaves the new plug-in outdated, so please write new code as GEGL
    plug-ins.
</li>
<li>GIMP currently has many file loaders/savers that would be good to have in GEGL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name='4'>Improve GEGL documentation,<a>
  <p> the GEGL website is generated as part of the
   GEGL build, patches to the documentation that fully integrates the changes
   also with the website are welcome. Documentation for the structure of
   GEGL and its internal architecture is also welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
   <a name='5'>Use GEGL in other places than GIMP</a>
   <ul>
   <li>Commandline tools for doing batch processing, UIs for compositing or
   image manipulation, video effects rendering and more are all things that are
   possible to implement with GEGL, that would end up sharing their available
   ops among each other.</li>
   <li>to provide incentive for yourself and others to work on the above
   points. GEGL is designed to be a generically usable API and does not cater
   especially for GIMP.</li>
   <li>The pluggable GeglBuffers of GEGL permit other tiled buffer systems
   (krita, mypaint?, a future blender?, a plug-in for GIMP 1.x, OpenStreetMap
   ?) to efficiently reuse GEGL operations as plug-ins without unneccesary
   buffer copying.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ol>
