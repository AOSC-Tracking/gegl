<p>
This isn't really a roadmap, it is more of a list of signs pointing in the
right direction.
</p>

<p>
There are various tracks that can be followed to improve the future of GEGL in
GIMP, many of these things, at least on the GEGL side are covered by bugs in
bugzilla, properly git formatted patches adressing these issues are most
welcome contributions. Doing things on this list would help speed up the
arrival of the next and more powerful generation of GIMP.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a name='1'>Improve GIMP/GEGL integration</a>
  <ul>
  <li>GIMP already can use GEGL for compositing its layers using GEGL and
    do its color manipulation using GEGL ops, it however still stores buffers
    in TileManagers and the integration with GEGL is done through proxy GEGL
    ops that fetch data from a TileManager or store data back in a
    TileManager.
  </li><li>The migration to GEGL should be done in such a way that GIMP does not
    lose any features during the migration, this to ensure that GIMP remains
    usable throuhout the development as well as permitting comparison between
    using GEGL and legacy code to compare performance and rendering.
    </li><li>Implement a GeglBuffer tile backend that support GIMP legacy
    TileManager for transition period</li>

  </li><li>Paint tools migration, work is already on the way to improve the performance
    of non destructive paths for GEGL.
  </li><li>Allow loading UI plug-ins for GIMP that provide custom UIs for GEGL ops.
    Such custom UI-s could first act like modal dialogs similar to the current
    GIMP plug-ins and later be the property panes of non destructive
    layer/effects or otherwise modifiable actions.
  </li><li>Integrate the GEGL tool with pdb.
  </li><li>Make the GEGL tool register menu entries in filters.
  </li><li>Create a GIMP legacy plug-in proxy op, that allows running at least a
    subset of GIMP plug-ins in non-interactive mode as GEGL ops, providing
    a fallback for legacy plug-ins in the future.</li>
   <li>Make single image raster import/export in GIMP use GEGL, perhaps also create a new improved templated with preview "export for web" workflow in GIMP based on GEGL</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name='2'>Improve GEGL</a>
  <ul>
  <li>performance, the code to allow GEGL splitting the evaluation work that
    is given to it among multiple threads is already mostly functional, but
    there are some rendering glitches due to some racy access of intermediate
    buffers, most likely caches. The behavior of such glitches can be seen
    by running 
      $ GEGL_THREADS=16 gegl
    This results in some <a href='threadbug.png'>serious rendering glitches</a>.
    Once this is stable, optimizing how the spatial division of the tasks is
    done would be good.
    The existing GPU backend branch and its auto-migrating hybrid
    tile management needs further work and testing, as
    well as maybe adaptation to use OpenCL instead of OpenGL GLSL.
  </li><li>GEGL already provides a lot of GIMPs core functionality; as well as many
    plug-ins. Some of this functionality is currently implemented as ops inside
    gimp. Porting more plug-ins and implementing infrastructure to be able to
    do more core functionality will benefit GIMP as the migration to GEGL goes
    forward.
  </li><li>Allow GEGL to run untrusted ops out-of process - ensuring that badly behaved
    ops will not bring GIMP/GEGL down.
   </li>
<!--<li>rewrite RAW loader to use <a href="http://www.libraw.org/">LibRaw</a> or <a 
                    href="http://sh0dan.blogspot.com/2009/02/introducing-rawspeed.html">Rawspeed</a> 
                    library instead of the abandoned libopenraw</li>-->
   <li>Implement COW of tiles for gegl_buffer_dup</li>
   <li>Implement previews working on mipmap levels, allowing GEGL to do a preview at 12.5%, 25% or 50% of actual size - rendering the full size view in the background or on demand.</li>
   <li>Finish GEGL side of GIMP/GEGL integration for rendering only the viewed part when zoomed in - allowing realtime tweaking and preview with on-canvas preview at 1:1 scale. (this involves accepting two regions to be rendered with priority or similar integration, the regions are already available in the GIMP code.)</li>
    <li>Allow GEGL to connect any property of ops as inputs/outputs in the graph, the infrastructure to do so
        is mostly already in place, but not properly exposed. For some uses, in particular for exposing more
        powerful meta-ops this would be very nice.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name='3'>Port GIMP plug-ins to GEGL ops</a>
  <ul>
   <li> Writing GEGL ops is simpler than writing GIMP plug-ins, plug-ins can support
    higher bit depth in the future. Floating point code is easier to write, less
    code is needed. You can get auto generated UI.
    Writing more GIMP legacy plug-ins only increases the future porting
    work-load/leaves the new plug-in outdated, so please write new code as GEGL
    plug-ins.
</li>
<li>GIMP currently has many file loaders/savers that would be good to have in GEGL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name='4'>Improve GEGL documentation,<a>
  <p> the GEGL website is generated as part of the
   GEGL build, patches to the documentation that fully integrates the changes
   also with the website are welcome. Documentation for the structure of
   GEGL and its internal architecture is also welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
   <a name='5'>Use GEGL in other places than GIMP</a>
   <ul>
   <li>Commandline tools for doing batch processing, UIs for compositing or
   image manipulation, video effects rendering and more are all things that are
   possible to implement with GEGL, that would end up sharing their available
   ops among each other.</li>
   <li>to provide incentive for yourself and others to work on the above
   points. GEGL is designed to be a generically usable API and does not cater
   especially for GIMP.</li>
   <li>The pluggable GeglBuffers of GEGL permit other tiled buffer systems
   (krita, mypaint?, a future blender?, a plug-in for GIMP 1.x, OpenStreetMap
   ?) to efficiently reuse GEGL operations as plug-ins without unneccesary
   buffer copying.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ol>
