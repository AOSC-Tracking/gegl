*GEGL* (Generic Graphics Library) is a data flow based image processing
framework, providing floating point processing and non-destructive image
processing capabilities to link:http://www.gimp.org/[GNU Image Manipulation
Program] and other projects (link:http://www.imgflo.org/[imgflo],
link:https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Photos[GNOME Photos],
link:https://github.com/the-grid/iconographer[iconographer], ...) as well as an
internal lua based UI frontend.

With GEGL you chain together processing link:operations/index.html[operations]
to represent the desired image processing pipeline. GEGL provides operations
for link:operations/GeglOperationSource.html[image loading] and
link:operations/GeglOperationSink.html[storing], link:operations/color.html[color adjustments], link:operations/artistic.html[GIMPs artistic] filters and more
forms of link:features.html[image processing] GEGL can also be used from the
link:commandline.html[commandline].

For programming with GEGL, either adding new operations or using it from
applications the link:html/index.html[API Reference] is useful, the API
of GEGL is available through GObject Introspection, but only the lua
binding has seen much testing.
