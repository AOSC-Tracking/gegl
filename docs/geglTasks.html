<br>The new ColorConvertOps dont use the new Op class (Op and ImageBuffer
inherit from Image now).</td>

<td><a NAME="6 copy_pixels, get_pixels"></a><b>#6 copy_pixels, get_pixels
- Implement these for ImageBuffer and Op classes.</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>Some of these routines need to be finished. In particular the Op classes
should return an error on copy_pixels since they are not writable and copy_pixels
is supposed to copy from a passed Image to the Image represented by this
(or self in GOB-speak)</td>

<td><a NAME="7 Remove Drawable, GraphicsState classes"></a><b>#7 Remove
Drawable, GraphicsState classes- Remove these classes from the tree.</b>
<br>Owner: caro@rhythm.com
<br>Gegl doesnt need these classes at present. This might be useful in
some future version of gegl, but these are higher level classes.</td>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="10 AreaOp - Write basic AreaOp class."></a><b>#10 AreaOp -
Write basic AreaOp class.&nbsp;</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>This abstract class is the next basic class needed to test the GIL
for these operations. This class will have to decide navigate the image
based on the storage details of the image (tiled vs non-tiled). So this
is somewhat dependent on #15, #14</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="11 GIL support for AreaOp"></a><b>#11 GIL support for AreaOp
- Extend GIL to handle AreaOps.&nbsp;</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>GIL will need to understand how to get rowstrides and access pixels.
This involves making sure GIL can interpret dY calls.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="12 ConvolveOp"></a><b>#12 ConvolveOp - Write basic ConvolveOp
class.&nbsp;</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>The ConvolveOp classes can be written once AreaOps are done. This will
involve writing details of handling the kernals and computations from these
(maybe need way of passing generic kernals).&nbsp;</td>

Iterator classes</b>
<br>Owner: none</td>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="14 Memory Management classes"></a><b>#14 Memory Management
classes - Write basic memory management classes</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>Gegl will need support for a cache to hold buffers as it computes operations.
So we need to support swapping unneeded/unused buffers to disk, and controlling
the cache. This is similar to gimps current tile scheme/memory management.
Not sure if gimp will use this gegl memory management or its own somehow,
but gegl still needs these classes to be a complete library.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="15 Additional Data Storage classes/types for ImageBuffer"></a><b>#15
Additional Data Storage classes/types for ImageBuffer - Write ImageBuffer
subclasses for these?</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>Gegl will have a standard (as yet undecided) ImageBuffer storage type.
This subclass(?) needs to be written. Right now the basic ImageBuffer has
pointers to each channel of image data and the entire image data resides
in memory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="16 GIL support for accessing channels"></a>#<b>16 GIL support
for accessing channels - Write GIL support for accessing individual color
channels.</b>
<br>Owner: none
<br>GIL currently has no way to reference the color channnels ie pixel.red
pixel.green, pixel.blue for rgb. This is needed for Ops that will write
GIL code and will want a standard way to refer to the color channels.&nbsp;</td>
