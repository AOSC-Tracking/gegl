We hope that you will join us in contributing to
the development of GIMP. GIMP is a great example
of an open source program whose advancement and
progress is clearly beneficial for the graphics
community at large. From a very practical point of
view, it can be made to solve many of the problems
that turn up with paint programs in production
settings. It is a solution that can last as well.
