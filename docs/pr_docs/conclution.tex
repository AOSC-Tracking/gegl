We think that GIMP 2.0 is the best alternative for solving 16bit paint needs in
the film and production world. 

\section{Commercial Paint Packages}

Several current 16bit Unix paint packages have uncertain futures. They 
are costly to install and usually involve working without full control
over image data types, and display look tables. 

\section{Call for Participation with GIMP}

We hope that you will join us in contributing to the development of GIMP. GIMP
is a great example of an open source program whose advancement and progress is
clearly beneficial for the graphics community at large. From a very practical
point of view, it can be made to solve many of the problems that turn up with
paint programs in production settings. It is a solution that can last as well.
