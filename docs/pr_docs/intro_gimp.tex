Though the upcoming 1.2 release of GIMP contains many new features, most
development effort since 1.0 version has involved improved ui and tools, and
little improvement in underlying architecture.  Internally GIMP is a monolithic
application with plug-in library wrapped around it (see Appendix  z0.

This makes it difficult to add things like color management, CMYK support,
different color models and data types. Without breaking GIMP into a series of
modules or libraries, moving forward with any major architectural enhancements
is impossible. So the plan for GIMP after 1.2 release is to break GIMP into
modules, separate the UI from the engine code, and give GIMP the flexibility to
handle the next stage of functionality. Unfortunately there is no way to avoid
this with GIMP's current state.
