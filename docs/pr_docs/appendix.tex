{\bf Initial HSV binning technique.} A color is mapped to one of five
bins in the initial clustering. We use the HSV color space to define
the bins. Hue values between 60-180 are mapped to green, 180-300 are mapped to
blue, and 0-60 and 300-360 are mapped to red. If the saturation is
smaller than .35 and the value is bigger than 0.7, the color is mapped to
white instead. A color whose value is smaller than .15 is mapped to black.\\
