GEGL is based on the GTK+ object model, an object oriented system that supports
inheritance, has an advanced signal and type system, and provides a reference
counting scheme for memory management. 

The main classes for GEGL are for images, image processing operators, and color
models. Operators and images inherit from a common abstract base class, so
image operation chains (or trees) can be set up with nodes representing either
images or image operations. Color and data conversions between inputs and
outputs is handled automatically if desired during computation of a chain. 

Each color model implements at least converters to and from an absolute CIE XYZ
color model. Specific color models may implement direct conversions between
common or closely related color models as well. 

Image processing on a chain is done by passing a destination image buffer and
region of interest and evaluating the chain to fill in the destination.
