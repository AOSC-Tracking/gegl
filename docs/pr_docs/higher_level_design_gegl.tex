GEGL is based on the Gtk+Object model, an object oriented class system that
supports inheritance, has an advanced signal and type system, and provides a
reference counting scheme for memory management of objects. The main classes
cover images, image processing operators, and color models.  Operators and
images inherit from a common abstract base class, and so image computing chains
or trees can be set up where nodes represent either images or image operations.
Color and data conversions between inputs and outputs can be handled
automatically during computation of a tree. Each color model implements at
least converters to and from an absolute CIE XYZ color model. Specific color
models may implement direct conversions between common or related color models
as well. Image processing is done on an image chain by specifying a destination
image buffer and region of interest and evaluating the chain on this
destination.  Memory management will include a cache and swapping system for
computation and image memory will typically consist of tiles of image data. The
image computations will be multi-threaded where possible as well.
