GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a new image processing library to be used by
GIMP 2.0. It will support different color models and data types
(8bit,16bit,float) in a general way, and allow new models and types to be added
easily.  It will include support for common image processing operations, and
provide a way to create chains of operations and apply these in a memory
efficient way.  Early versions will include operations needed by GIMP 2.0, and
later versions will add a full library of image processing operations and color
models. GEGL is available from http://www.gegl.org.
