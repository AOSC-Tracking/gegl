GEGL (generic graphics library) is a new image processing library to be used by
GIMP 2.0 and other image editing applications. It will handle color spaces and
data types in a general way, and allow new spaces and types to be added easily.
It will include support for a range of image processing operations, and provide
a way to create chains of operations and apply these in a memory efficient way.
Early versions will include operations needed by GIMP 2.0, and later versions 
will add a full library of image processing operations and color models.
