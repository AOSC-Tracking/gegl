GEGL (generic graphics library) is a new image processing library to be used by
GIMP and other image editing applications. It will handle many color spaces and
data types in a general way, and allow new ones to be added easily. It will
include support for common image operations, and provide a simple way to create
chains of operations and apply these in a memory efficient way.
