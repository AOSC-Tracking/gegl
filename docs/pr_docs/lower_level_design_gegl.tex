GEGL will include a comprehensive set of operators for point, area, geometric
and statistics operations. For these, different data types (ie bit depths) for
channels and color models will be handled through generic programming
techniques. This involves using a Generic Image Language (GIL), a simple image
manipulation and algorithm description language designed as part of GEGL.  

Image algorithms will be written where possible using GIL and particular data
type and color model cases will be generated from their GIL description.
Though many image processing algorithms are well suited to this style of
generic coding, it will be necessary to allow partial specialization techniques
where a generic approach is not suitable. 

Memory management will include a cache and swapping system. Image data will
typically consist of tiles. Multi-threaded computation of operations is planned
where possible. For efficiency, region of interests and domains of definitions
will be calculated to avoid doing unnecessary computations.
