The low level design of GEGL includes a comprehensive set of operators for
point, area, geometric and statistics operations.  For all of these, different
data types (ie bit depths) for channels and color models are handled through
generic programming techniques. This involves the Generic Image Language (GIL),
a simple image manipulation and algorithm description language designed as part
of GEGL. This allows algorithms to be written in pseudo-code like fashion and
particular data type and color model cases are then generated from this
description. Most image processing algorithms are well suited to this style of
generic coding, but it will also be possible to do specialization for certain
algorithms or color models within GEGL as well. Efficiency memory management
will be achieved through a cache and tile system. Region of interests and
domains of definitions will be tracked to avoid over computation.
