\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf libgimpcore} will interface with gegl. does all the non-ui stuff
\item {\bf libgimpcoreui} contains the starting building blocks for all the ui. it
is like xwindows is for motif
\item {\bf libgimpui} this is the actuall interface for gimp. it is build from
the gimpwidget. 
\item {\bf libgimpwidget} this is build on top of gimpcoreui. it contains all the
ui widgets. will these widget be smart enough to display themselves in the
right data range???
\item {\bf libgimpiface} this is an interface to the core and the ui for the
plug-in.
\item {\bf libgimpplugin} this is the plug-in library
\item {\bf libgimpextapp} this is a communication interface that the application
will use to comunicate with the plug-in
\item {\bf libgimpapp} this is the application for the gimp
\item {\bf libgimpjunk} contains random support things
