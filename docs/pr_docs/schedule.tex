The schedule for achieving GIMP2.0 is broken into three main parts. 

The first part involves the development of GEGL. Since GEGL is a low-level
library to be used by GIMP, work for it can proceed somewhat independent of
GIMP.    

Once GEGL is far enough along, a simple skeleton of imaging and painting tools
will be developed using GEGL. This stripped down version is called MicroGIMP
and will include some simple paint, retouch and editing tools, enough to
provide first tests of each of the major areas of functionality for GIMP:
painting, editing, compositing, color conversions. 

After MicroGimp is built and tested as a small production tool, the rest of the
major GIMP libraries will be built. These libraries include the various GIMP UI
libs and the core code for GIMP's graphics objects (Images, Layers, Channels,
Drawables). GIMPs task management (rendering pipeline), libraries for plugin
communication  as well as GIMPs component for scripting (PDB, Procedural Data
Base) are all included here.
