GEGL is currently in a development stage, and work is ongoing for most of the
major classes.

The abstract base image and operator classes for creating and processing chains
of image operations have been written. The Generic Image Language (GIL) has
been implemented for the case of point operators using lex/yacc to generate
code for some basic common color models (RGB, Gray) and data types (float,
    8bit, 16bit).  Current work on AreaOps in GIL is beginning. The color model
inheritance classes and accompanying data/colors pace converters which provide
support for converting color models/data types during image processing has been
written as well.

The memory management classes for caching and tiling, as well as efficient
computation of chains of operations using regions of interests and domains of
definition are beginning design. For details of GEGL progress, see
