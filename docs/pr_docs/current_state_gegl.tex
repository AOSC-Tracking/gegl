GEGL is currently in a development stage, and work is ongoing for most of the
major classes.

The basic image and operator classes that provide the underlying structure for
creating and processing chains of image operations have been written. The
generic approach to writing image algorithms using the Generic Image Language
has been implemented for the case of point operators using lex/yacc to generate
code for some common color models.  Also the color model inheritance classes
and accompanying data/colorspace converters which provide support for a range
of ColorModels and a general way of converting between these during image
processing has been written as well.

The memory management issues of caching and tiling, as well as efficient
computation of chains of operations using regions of interests and domains of
definition are under current development.
