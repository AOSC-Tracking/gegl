Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis wrote the first version of GIMP, released in
1995 as GIMP 0.54. This original version worked with the Motif UI toolkit, and
was later replaced with an open source UI toolkit written specifically for GIMP
called the GIMP Toolkit (GTK+, see http://www.gtk.org/).

The next main release was GIMP version 0.99 which came out in 1997. This
version included new tile memory management, transparency layers, and a plugin
architecture. In May 1998 version 1.0 of GIMP was released, with the stable
version 1.0.4 shortly after that.

The GIMP 1.1 series of developer releases has continued throughout 1999 and
2000 and is currently at version 1.1.25 (Sept.  2000). The current development
versions are being debugged and stabilized with the goal of releasing GIMP 1.2
based on these in the very near future.
