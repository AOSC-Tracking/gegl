After using GIMP in film production for a year and a half, it is clear there
are also certain areas where GIMP needs improvement to become a full-featured
and mature paint tool for film work:

Alpha channel access and editing\\
Direct access to the matte or alpha channel of a RGBA image is very important
for film work. It is currently only possible to view and edit the alpha channel
of an image in GIMP only indirectly and with some trouble.  

Color Channel visibility and editing\\
It is difficult to edit single color channels (r,g,b) and cut and paste easily
between color channels. Swapping color channels is hard as well.

Memory usage\\
Too much memory is used for some simple operations, and this is especially 
a when large images are involved. Just two 2k layers of images usually becomes
difficult to manipulate and use

Speed\\
Some operations are slow, and could use more efficient algorithms.

Resolution independence\\
It should be easy to re-use image operations at several resolutions. Spatial
parameters should scale correctly to make this work.
