This paper discusses the General Image Manipulation Program (GIMP,
http://www.gimp.org) and its possible use in film and production enviroments.
Gimp is a freely available open source paint program. It can be downloaded with
source code, and built and installed on most Unix and Windows machines.  It has
a standard set of painting and image editing tools, similar to Adobe Photoshop.
It supports plug-ins and scripting.

Because source code is available GIMP can be customized to fit the needs of
production. Experimental versions which support 16bit channels have been built
and proven useful in production for over a year [see Appendix C].

With the unstable future of many of the current 16bit per channel off-the-shelf
paint packages on the Unix platform, GIMP has a definite advantage for the film
industry. It provides an opportunity to build and contribute to a stable and
customizable solution for many of the particular needs of production. 

This document describes GIMP and gives some details about the upcoming
architectural changes for future versions. It also discusses ways interested
parties can help contribute to the GIMP community. 

The following is an outline of the topics we cover:

\begin{itemize}

\item Chapter \ref{ch:GIMP_2.0_Design} ``GIMP 2.0 Design'' describes 
the basic architecture of GIMP 2.0.

\item Chapter \ref{ch:GEGL} ``GEGL'' reviews the most concretely realized 
component of GIMP 2.0, the GEGL library. GEGL will be the heart of
the GIMP 2.0 image processing engine.

\item Chapter \ref{ch:Schedule} ``Schedule'' is a list of tasks for GIMP 2.0 which
cover the main areas involved in creating the next version. It lists some rough schedule
estimates.  

\item Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusion}, ``Conclusion'' wraps up. 

\end{itemize}

In addition, the appendices cover some extra material:

\begin{itemize}

\item Appendix  \ref{ch:GIMP_Versions_Licences} ``GIMP Versions Licenses'' which
covers versions 0.54 to 1.2 and the experimental HOLLYWOOD branch. It also
discusses GIMP's license.
  
\item Appendix  \ref{ch:GIMP_at_Rhythm_Hues}  ``GIMP at Rhythm \& Hues
Studios'' goes into details of the use of the HOLLYWOOD branch GIMP in a
production setting. 

\item Appendix \ref{ch:Contributing_to_GIMP} ``Contributing to GIMP'' This is a
short description of how things get done in Open Source projects.

\item Appendix \ref{ch:More_Information} ``More Information'' contains URLs to
webpages with more information.

\end{itemize}
