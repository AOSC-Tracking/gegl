GEGL will be used in the future as the GIMP image processing engine, starting
with version 2.0. As the new GIMP 2.0 libraries are written, a simple skeleton
set of imaging and painting tools will be developed first using the new GIMP 2.0
and GEGL libraries. 

Once this simple set of tools is in place, production testing will begin. This
set will include simple painting, cloning, cut, copy and paste editing and
selection tools. Testing this simple skeleton set of tools in production will
provide tests of the stability of GEGL and the GIMP 2.0 libraries. This code 
will then become the next series of developer releases.
