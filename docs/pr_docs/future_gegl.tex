GEGL will be used in the future as the main GIMP image processing engine, for
versions 2.0 and up.  As the GIMP libraries for 2.0 are written, a simple
skeleton set of imaging and painting tools will be developed first and the new
libraries for GIMP and GEGL will be tested in this simple setting initially. The
new painting core libraries and compositing engine for layers in GIMP will use
GEGL operations exclusively for all its imaging, and some production use and testing
should already be done with simple set of tools. This simple set of tools
will include things like painting, cloning, cut and paste, and simple
editing tools.
