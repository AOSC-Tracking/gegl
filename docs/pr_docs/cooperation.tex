To make sure that all our efforts satisfies all our needs in the shortest amount of time it is essential that we have a good understanding of what the specifications are and how to going about to realize them. 

We have presented a tentative plan of what is needed to get a version of GIMP ready to be tested by users. Currently our cost estimate of this is approximated 4000 man-hours. The more people that join GIMP team the faster we will see this new version.

Because all of us will be working from different locations and probably will not have the luxury to go down the hall to talk to the other members to clarify a point it is essential that we have a clear vision of how all the parts work together before we all start coding.

We propose that we all (current gimp team and the new team mates) meet in person to clarify all the points. During this meeting we will finalize the specifications, the schedule and dived up the project between us.

To make the meeting a success it is important to come prepared. We would want all the involved member have a clear vision of what they need and have a understanding of the current design. 

All communication between us after we have left the meeting will happen through email and through documentations that we post to the web. We want to have weekly status reports from all the members to make sure that we are not faced with any surprises further down the line. Maybe bi-monthly meeting would be a good way to reevaluate and make sure we are on the right track.
