To make sure that all our efforts satisfies all our needs in the shorts amount of time it is essential that we have a good understanding of what the specifications are and how to going about to realize them. 

We have presented a tentative plan of what is needed to get a version of IMP ready to be tested in production. Currently our cost estimate of this is approximated 4000 man-hours. The more people that join IMP team the faster we will see this new version provided that we have a organized way of diving up the work amongst ourselves.

Because all of us will be working from different places and probably will not have the ability to go down the hall to talk to the other member to clarify a point it is essential that we have a clear vision of how all the parts work together before we all start coding.

We propose that we all meet in person to clarify all the points. During this meeting we will finalize the specification, the schedule and dived up the project between us.

In order to make the meeting a success it is important to come prepared. We would want all the involved member have a clear vision of what they need and have a understanding of the current design. 

All communication between us after we have left the meeting will happen through an email and through documentation that we post to the web. We want to have weekly status reports of all the members to make sure that we are not faced with any surprises further down the line. Maybe bi-monthly meeting would be a good way to reevaluate and make sure we are on the right track.
