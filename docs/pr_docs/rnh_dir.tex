Rhythm \& Hues is very excited about GIMP's future and will continue to support
GIMP by contributing programming and other resources to the GIMP project. These
contributions are intended to advance the GIMP community at large and are made
available to everyone through the normal open source process. Additions,
improvements, bug fixes and changes made by Rhythm and Hues are meant to
further the project in general.

Rhythm \& Hues would like to see more contributors join the GIMP effort, and
not only from the film industry. It is important that the GIMP continues to
have a development team with a variety of interests and backgrounds to insure
GIMP does not become a specialized tool for a limited group of users.

It is hoped that the unique opportunity that GIMP provides is clear motivation
for getting other production companies, software developers and users
contributing to and promoting this project as well.
