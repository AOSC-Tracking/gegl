Rhythm \& Hues is excited about GIMP's future and will continue to support and
contribute to the GIMP community. These contributions are made available to
everyone through the normal open source process. Additions, improvements, bug
fixes and changes made by Rhythm and Hues are released publicly back to the
GIMP project.

It is hoped that the unique opportunity that GIMP provides is clear motivation
for other production companies, software developers and users to contribute to
and promote this project as well.
