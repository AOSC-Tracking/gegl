Rhythm \& Hues is very excited about GIMP's future and is glad to be apart of it. They want to continue to help GIMP be a leader among the 8 bit paint programs and also help it becoming a strong tool for film production. 

Rhythm \& Hues would like to see more programmers join GIMP team, not only from the film industry. It is important that the GIMP continues having a team with a variety of interest and background to insure that GIMP does not become a specialized tool for a limited group of users.
