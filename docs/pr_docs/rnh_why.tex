Rhythm \& Hues Studios have a long tradition of having its proprietry 
software packages. We have our own render, animation package,
compositor, modeler, and, before the GIMP our own, paint package. 

The GIMP is open source which makes it a perfect match for how we work at
R\&H. With the GIMP we are still able to tailer our software to our
TDs' needs, which we find hard to do with off the shelf software.  

We have our own file format and with the GIMP we have no color lose.
This allows our TDs to only touch one frame, without haveing to pass
the whole shot through some color conversion.

There are no user licenses for the GIMP, meaning that we dont have to
pay x amount of dollars for each machine we want to be able to use it.
