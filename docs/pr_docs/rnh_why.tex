Since the very beginning, Rhythm \& Hues has had its own proprietary software packages. It has its own renderer, animation package, modeler, compositor, and before the GIMP its' own paint package.\\ 

Having access to the source code of its software has allowed Rhythm \& Hues to fully integrate its software into its production pipeline, customize software for a specific show, develop show specific software solutions to difficult problems, and produce integrated software solutions.

The GIMP is the perfect choice for Rhythm \& Hues because it is open source it can be treated as an in-house software package and therefore fully exploited to its maximum potential. Currently Rhythm \& Hues uses the GIMP in conjunction with its in-house fur program and there are plans to integrate the GIMP into its' compositor to make the "talking animal" pipeline even more efficient.

Rhythm \& Hues has its own image file formate. Using off-the-shelf paint packages produces color loss, which makes it impossible to use these software to touch up one frame in a scene. With the GIMP, R\&H eliminating the color loss problem, because it is able to customize the internals of the software. 

There are no individual user license for the GIMP which makes it possible to allow all TDs to have a copy of the GIMP on their machine.
