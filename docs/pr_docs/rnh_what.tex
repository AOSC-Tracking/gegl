Rhythm \& Hues is always attempting to improve GIMP in new ways for production.
This means implementing tools and feature requests from TDs. The software
department must respond to the production needs for a tool to insure continued
use and growth.\\

Here are some standard ways GIMP is used in production 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Dusting and touching up frames }
\item {\em Texture painting  }
\item {\em Painting mattes }
\item {\em Painting maps }
\item {\em Rig and wire removal in scenes where procedural methods are impossible. } 

To make this possible new features were added to GIMP. In this case the ability
to flip through frames was added. 
\item {\em Together with other in-house programs. } 

Rhythm \& Hues uses GIMP in conjunction with its in-house fur program and there
are plans to integrate GIMP closely with the compositor to make the "talking
animal" pipeline even more efficient.
\end{itemize}
