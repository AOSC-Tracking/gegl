Rhythm \& Hues Studios uses the film version of GIMP in production currently.
This is the 16-bit version that was based on the GIMP1.0 code base. GIMP is
used for some specific tasks, but also as a general image-editing tool that
is installed on every TDs machine.

Here are some of the ways that GIMP is used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Texture painting 
\item Rig and wire removal in scenes where procedural methods are impossible.
\item Painting mattes
\item Painting maps
\item Dusting frames
\end{itemize}

Rhythm \& Hues also uses GIMP in conjunction with its in-house fur program and
there are plans to integrate GIMP closely with the compositor to make the
"talking animal" pipeline even more efficient.

Also because there are various production supervisors that try to push GIMP in
their shows, GIMP is finding new uses all the time.
