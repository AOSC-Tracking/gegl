GIMP is used at Rhythm \& Hues in a number of different ways, from simple
retouching and cloning to more specialized fur painting.

Here are some standard uses for GIMP in production 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Dusting and touching up frames }
\item {\em Texture painting  }
\item {\em Painting mattes }
\item {\em Painting maps }
\item {\em Rig and wire removal in scenes where procedural methods are impossible. } 

To make this possible new features were added to GIMP. In this case the ability
to flip through frames was added
\item {\em Together with other in-house programs. } 

Rhythm \& Hues uses GIMP in conjunction with its in-house fur program and there
are plans to integrate GIMP closely with the compositor to make the "talking
animal" pipeline even more efficient.
\end{itemize}
