GIMP is liked as a paint program at R\&H but at the same time it has a hard time compeating with the big off-the-shelf paint programs. Production at Rhythm \& Hues Studios is always trying to use it in new ways. This means that tools are constantly added to the GIMP to allow TDs to do their work. Software feels it is important to respond quickly to production to insure the continue use of GIMP.\\ 

Here are some standard ways GIMP is used in production 
\begin{itemize}
\item Dusting and touching up frames
\item Texture painting 
\item Painting mattes
\item Painting maps
\item Rig and wire removal in scenes where procedural methods are impossible. To make this possible new features were added to GIMP. In this case the ability to flip through frames was added. 
\item Together with other in-house programs
\end{itemize}

Rhythm \& Hues uses GIMP in conjunction with its in-house fur program and
there are plans to integrate GIMP closely with the compositor to make the
"talking animal" pipeline even more efficient.
