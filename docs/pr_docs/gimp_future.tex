In the beginning of June of 2000 the core GIMP developers meet in Berlin to discuss the future of the GIMP. It was clear to everyone that the point has come to do our first rewrite of the GIMP.   

This conference was founded by the Free Software Foundation, Chaos Computer Club, and O'Reilly Germany.
