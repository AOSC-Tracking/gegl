In June 2000 the first official GIMP Developers Conference took place in
Berlin. At the meeting many of the core developers discussed the future
direction of GIMP.

The main topic of the conference was a new architecture for GIMP and a
corresponding set of libraries. The remaining sections in this chapter describe
the new architecture and design.
