In June 2000 the first official GIMP Developers Conference took place in
Berlin. This conference was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, the
Chaos Computer Club, and O'Reilly Germany and organized by Sven Neuman and
Michael Natterer. At the meeting most of the core developers met to discuss the
future direction of GIMP.

A plan for reaching GIMP 2.0 was discussed. The current architecture of GIMP
makes it difficult to move forward with the plans for color management, CMYK
support, and high color resolution channels. The GIMP core code was not broken
into independent modules or libraries after reaching 1.0 in a reasonable
manner, and consequently it has become difficult to work with, and hard to
extend. A new set of libraries for the different parts of GIMP 2.0 were
discussed.

The plan is to make the GIMP more general and more modular allowing new
functionality to be added with greater ease. GIMP 2.0 will be the first version
that will contain the new set of libraries.
