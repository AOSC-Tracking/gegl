In the beginning of June the first official GIMP Developers Conference took place in Berlin. This conference was sponsored by ... and organized by Sven Neuman and .... At the meeting most of the core developers met to discuss the future direction of the GIMP.

It was clear to everyone that the GIMP needs to be rewritten to be able to support all the new features such as CMYK color space and 16 bit color depth. It would be near impossible to add major features to the current code base and it would not be soon when it would be impossible to do so. 

Our plan is to make the GIMP more general and more modular thereby allowing new feature down the road to be added with great ease. GIMP 2.0 will be the version that will contain this new code base.
