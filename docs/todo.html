       <a name='To do'><h2>To do</h2></a>
       <p>A temporally deficient roadmap for GEGL</p>

<a name='Buffer'><h2>Buffer</h2></a>

<p>
Make GeglBuffer be an interface (or a use composition and allow for 
TiledBackend, LinearBackend GimpTileManagerBackend). This will make
integration with legacy GIMP code much easier.
<p>

<ul>
Desired backends:
<li>further evolution of horizon/gegl tile interface with tiled mipmapping</li>
<li>linear buffers</li>
<li>gimp tile manager</li>
<li>GPU memory (for shader code)</li>
<li>verse</li>
<li>krita</li>
<li>image/graphics-magick?</li>
</ul>

<a name='Evaluation'><h2>Evaluation</h2></a>

<h3>Optimized evaluation methods</h3>

<p>
Right now all computation is done in 32bit floating point RGBA. Allowing to
register optimized versions of different pixel formats (that can be regression
tested against the float implementation) is and important step. This would also
allow to plug-in external code, like snippets of cairo code to do evaluation in
8bit.
</p>

<h3>Pixel format negotiation</h3>

<p>
When more pixel-format versions exist of OPs, more works needs to be done
when iterating the GRAPH, the desired op, and the format with which the
image data flows in the graph needs to be negotiatied between speed and quality.
</p>

<h3>Multithreading</h3>

<p>
Make it possible to have multiple evaluations of the graph happening at the
same time. (both the way the visitor pattern is implemented, and the reference
counting for immediate freeing of buffers assumes a single thread of operation
at the moment.) The multithreading would allow splitting the image up into
rectangular "work sections", that are requested for rendering.
</p>

<h3>GeglColor</h3>

<p>A data type, that is also chantable for the operations With convenience
methods to get a single chunky pixel in any given babl format, as well as being
settable as such. </p>
<p>More convencience methods for set/get rgba lab luminance or similar things
can be added on top of this</p>
<p>Internally it should probably just store a RGBA32 float for now</p>
<p>It should also be capable of generating/parsing strings of the forms:
</p>
<pre
>#fff
#ffffff
white
rgb(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
rgba(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
#ffff
#ffffffff
</pre>
<p>All interpreted as fully opaque white.
</p>

<a name='XML'><h2>XML</h2></a>

<p>
A file format is gradually evolving, the XML handling might even end up handling
multiple different file formats, at the moment work being done to improve
interoperability through efforts to define an Exhange format for structured
Raster data. <a href='http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/index.php/OpenRaster'>OpenRaster</a>, <a href='http://pippin.gimp.org/OpenRaster/'>xml sketches</a></p>


<a name='Operations'><h2>Operations</h2></a>

<h3>GIMP plug-in proxy op.</h3>

<p>
A GEGL operation acting as a proxy to legacy gimp plug-ins will drag a lot
of the existing GIMP functionality along. This probably depends on having a
gimp-tile manager backend for gegl buffers working for as smooth as possible
implementation.
</p>

<h3>GEGL operation API freeze</h3>

<p>
At some point the plug-in api for GEGL should be declared stable. It isn't yet
since it doesn't allow registering optimized versions. And there are some confusing naming of the methods needed when implementing.
</p>

<h3>Caching operation</h3>

<p>
Write an operations that maintains a sparse backing buffer the size of the HAVE
rect of the operations. Keeps rendered information, and keeps cached computations
as long as the properties have not changed.</p>

<p>
An initial implementation of this should be designed to work directly on top of
source nodes only. Later a similar approach could be extended to work on subgraphs,
multiple such caches could be used as well, speeding up reevaluations at the expense
of extra tiles used for caching intermediate results.</p>

<p>It could be possible to measure the efficiency of a cache in a particular location,
and decide to retire it,. or move it down in the graph. Based on profiling data of
property changes over time,. it should be possible to discover optimal cache points
in the graph.
</p>

<h3>text source</h3>

<p>
Use pango for rendering, expose more parameters, perhaps look at integrating
the pango interface provided by GIMP?
</p>

<h3>SVG loader</h3>

<p>
With basis in the text source (which uses cairo), create an operation that renders
to a buffer in a similar fashion using librsvg for the SVG parsing.</p>

<a name='GIL'><h3>GIL</h3></a>

<p><a href='genericImageLanguage.html'>GIL</a> and <a href='codegen.html'>codegen</a> should probably be resurrected as well, this work would depend on
pixel format negotiation to be in place first.
