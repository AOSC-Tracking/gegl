GEGL
----
GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a graph based image processing framework.

GEGL's original design was made to scratch http://www.gimp.org/[GIMP]'s itches
for a new compositing and processing core. This core is being designed to have
minimal dependencies. and a simple well defined API.

Bugzilla
~~~~~~~~
The GEGL project uses http://bugzilla.gnome.org/[GNOME Bugzilla], a
bug-tracking system that allows us to coordinate bug reports. Bugzilla is also
used for enhancement requests and the preferred way to submit patches for GEGL
is to open a bug report and attach the patch to it. Bugzilla is also the
closest you will find to a roadmap for GEGL.

Building from source
--------------------
GEGL and it's dependencies are known to work on Linux based systems, windows with msys/mingw,
and probably other platforms.

Download
~~~~~~~~
The latest development snapshot, and eventually stable versions of GEGL are
available at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gegl/[].

The current code under development can be
http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gegl/trunk/[browsed online] and checked out from
GNOME Subversion using:

 $ svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/babl/trunk/ babl
 $ svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gegl/trunk/ gegl

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

GEGL is currently building on linux, the build enviroment probably needs some
fixes before all of it builds gracefully on many platforms. If building from
a subversion checkout you need to have ruby installed.

  - Core
      * glib (including gobject, and gmodule) 2.10 or newer, which provides
        inheritance, dynamic modules, common algorithms and data structures for
        C programming.
      * http://gegl.org/babl/[babl] 0.0.14 or newer (for pixel-format agnostisism).
      * libpng (png load/export ops, and image magick fallback import)
  - GUI (sandbox for testing ops and the API)
      * GTK+
  - Optional dependencies for operations.
      * SDL (display op)
      * libjpeg (jpg loader op)
      * libopenexr (exr loader op)
      * cairo, pango (text source op)
      * avcodec, avformat (ff-load and experimental ff-save)
      * librsvg (svg loader)
   - Documentation
      * asciidoc

Compiling
~~~~~~~~
To build GEGL type the following in the toplevel source directory:

 $ ./configure  # or: ./autogen.sh if building from svn
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


Documentation
-------------
With GEGL you chain together image processing operations represented by nodes
into a graph. GEGL provides such operations for loading and storing images,
adjusting colors, filtering images in different ways, translating images and

GEGLs programmer/user interface is a Directed Acyclic Graph of nodes. The DAG
expresses a processing chain of operations. A DAG, or any node in it, expresses
a composited and processed image. It is possible to request rectangular regions
in a wide range of pixel formats from any node.


Public API
~~~~~~~~~~
The link:api.html[public API] is the API used for creating things with GEGL,
this API does not change much at all and is also the API provided by language
bindings. To make the public API available when compiling a .c file add
#include <link:gegl.h.html[gegl.h]>, compile and link with the flags provided
by pkg-config and you should be all set. When you are comfortable with the
public API, or are using GEGL in some project looking at the
link:operations.html[Operation reference] might be useful.

Bindings
^^^^^^^^
The bindings for use of GEGL in other programming languages than C are
co-hosted with GEGL in GNOME subversion but are not part of the regular GEGL
distribution. The following language bindings are currently available:
link:rgegl/index.html[ruby], link:pygegl/index.html[python]:: and 
link:gegl-sharp/index.html[C#/Mono].

Hello world
^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a small sample GEGL application that animates a zoom on a mandelbrot
fractal

---------------------------
sys::[cat hello-world.c]
---------------------------

 $ gcc hello-world.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags gegl` -o hello-world


Operation API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An API to extend the functionality of GEGL with new image processing primitive,
file loaders, export formats or similar. 

Each GEGL operation is defined in a .c file that gets turned into a single
shared object that is loaded. Each operation is a subclass of one of the
provided base classes:

link:gegl-operation.h.html[GeglOperation]::
    The base operation class, which all the other base classes are derived
    from, deriving from this is often quite a bit of work and is encouraged
    only when your operation doesn't fit into any of the other categories
  GeglOperationFilter::
    The filter base class sets up GeglBuffers for input and output pads

  GeglOperationPointFilter::
    The point-filter base class is for filters where an output pixel only
    depends on the color and alpha values of the corresponding input pixel.
    This allows you to do the processing on linear buffers, in the future
    versions of GEGL operations implemented using the point-filter will get
    speed increases due to more intelligent processing possible in the point
    filter class

  GeglOperationAreaFilter::
    The AreaFilter base class allows defining operations where the output data
    depends on a neighbourhood with an input window that extends beyond the
    output window, the information about needed extra pixels in different
    directions should be set up in the prepare callback for the operation.

  GeglOperationComposer::
    Composer operations are operations that take two inputs named 'input' and
    'aux' and writes their output to the output pad 'output'

  GeglOperationPointComposer::
    A baseclass for composer functions where the output pixels values depends
    only on the values of the single corresponding input and aux pixels.

  GeglOperationSource::
    Operations used as render sources or file loaders, the process method
    receives a GeglBuffer to write it's output into

  GeglOperationSink::
    An operation that consumes a GeglBuffer, used for filewriters, display (for
    the sdl display node)

  GeglOperationMeta::
    Used for GEGL operations that are implemented as a sub-graph, at the moment
    these are defined as C files but should in the future be possible to
    declare as XML instead.

To create your own operations you should start by looking for one that does
approximatly what you already need. Copy it to a new .c source file, and
replace the occurences of the filename (operation name in the source.)

Most of the operations try to trim down the amount of needed GObject boilerplate
and provides a chanting framework creating with the C preprocessor that makes defining
introspectable typed and documented properties easy.

Take a look at link:brightness-contrast.c.html[the brightness contrast operation] for
a simple point operation well sprinkled with comments.

//XML data model
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//The tree allows clones, making it possible to express any acyclic graph where
//the nodes are all of the types: source, filter and composer.
//
//GEGL can write and reads its data model to and from XML. The XML is chains of
//image processing commands, where some chains allow a child chain (the 'over'
//operator to implement layers for instance).
//
//The type of operation associated with a node can be specified either with a
//class attribute or by using the operation name as the tag name for the node.
//
//or documentation on how this XML works, take a look at the sources in the
//gallery. And browse the documentation for operations.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Some environment variables can be set to alter how GEGL runs, this list might
not be exhaustive but it should list the most useful ones.

BABL_STATS::
    When set babl will write a html file (/tmp/babl-stats.html) containing a
    matrix of used conversions, as well as all existing conversions and which
    optimized paths are followed.
BABL_ERROR::
    The amount of error that babl tolerates, set it to for instance 0.1 to use
    some conversions that trade some quality for speed.
GEGL_DEBUG_BUFS::
    Display tile/buffer leakage statistics.
GEGL_DEBUG_RECTS::
    Show the results of have/need rect negotiations.
GEGL_DEBUG_TIME::
    Print a performance instrumentation breakdown of GEGL and it's operations.
GEGL_SWAP::
    The directory where temporary swap files are written, if not specified GEGL
    will not swap to disk. Be aware that swapping to disk is still experimental
    and GEGL is currently not removing the per process swap files.


gegl
~~~~
GEGL provides a commandline tool called gegl, for working with the XML data
model from file, stdin or the commandline. It can display the result of
processing the layer tree or save it to file.

Some examples:

Render a composition to a PNG file:

 $ gegl composition.xml -o composition.png

Invoke gegl like a viewer for gegl compositions:

 $ gegl -ui -d 5 composition.xml

Using gegl with png's passing through stdin/stdout piping.

 $ cat input.png | gegl -o - -x "<gegl>
    <tree>
      <node class='invert'/>
      <node class='scale' x='0.5' y='0.5'/>
      <node class='png-load' path='-'/></tree></gegl>" > output.png

The latest development version is available in the gegl module in GNOME
Subversion.

gegl usage
^^^^^^^^^^
The following is the usage information of the gegl binary, this documentation
might not be complete.

-------
sys::[bash -c '../bin/gegl -h 2>&1']

Appendixes
----------

Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

The main source of documentation as GEGL grows is the
link:operations.html[operations reference]. Plug-ins themselves register
information about the categories they belong to, what they do, and
documentation of the available parameters.

Glossary
~~~~~~~~
connection::
    A link/pipe routing image flow between operations within the graph goes
    from an output pad to an input pad, in graph glossary this might also be
    reffered to as an edge.
DAG::
    Directed Acyclic Graph, see graph.
graph::
    A composition of nodes, the graph is a DAG.
node::
    The nodes are connected in the graph. A node has an associated operation or
    can be constructed graph.
operation::
    The processing primitive of GEGL, is where the actual image processing
    takes place. Operations are plug-ins and provide the actual functionality
    of GEGL
pad::
    The part of a node that exchanges image content. The place where image
    "pipes" are used to connect the various operations in the composition.
input pad::
  consumes image data, might also be seen as an image parameter to the
  operation.
output pad::
  a place where data can be requested, multiple input pads can reference
  the same output pad.
property::
    Properties are what control the behavior of operations, through the use of
    GParamSpecs properties are self documenting through introspection.
