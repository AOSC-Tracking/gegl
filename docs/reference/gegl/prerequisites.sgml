    <para>
      Before you configure and build GEGL you need various tools and libraries
      installed on your system. These are described below. For the exact
      version of the each tool required refer to the file called HACKING in the
      top level GEGL directory. The <filename>configure</filename> 
      (or <filename>autogen.sh</filename>) script will also tell you if 
      you are missing some of these when you run it. 
    </para>
    <para>
      These are the dependencies for building GEGL:

    <listitem>
    <para>
      GNU autotools build utilities: <command>autoconf</command>, 
      <command>automake</command>, and <command>libtool</command>. 
      <command>autoconf</command> is
      for package configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <command>automake</command> for building makefiles that comply
      with the GNU Coding Standards, and <command>libtool</command> for
      building shared libraries on multiple platforms. These are all available
      from  <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software">GNU</ulink>.
    </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/">
      <command>pkg-config</command></ulink>: This is a tool for tracking 
      the compilation flags needed for libraries that are used by the GEGL 
      libraries. (For each library, a small <literal>.pc</literal> text file 
      is installed in a standard location that contains the compilation flags needed 
      for that library along with version number information.)  The 
      version of <command>pkg-config</command> needed to build GEGL 
      can usually be found in <filename>dependencies</filename> directory at the 
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.2/">GTK+ FTP site.</ulink>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU
	  <command>make</command></ulink>: GEGL will mostly work with 
      different versions of <command>make</command>, however, there tends 
      to be a few incompatibilities, so it is recommended to
	  install the GNU version if you don't already have it on 
      your system. (It may be called <command>gmake</command>
	  rather than <command>make</command>.)

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  GLib: This is an object and type system available
      from the <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</ulink> project. 
      GEGL uses the GObject base class from GLib as superclass
      for all GEGL classes. GLib provides a property system for 
      describing attributes of objects, support for callbacks (signals) 
      and interfaces (GInterface). There is also support for many common 
      data types and utilities. The correct version can usually be found at the  
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.2/">GTK+ FTP site.</ulink>

    <title>Building Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
      For the most part the prerequisites for GEGL are similar to those 
      for building GLib.
    </para>
    <para>
      First install any necessary utilities you dont have: autotools(
      <command>autoconf</command>, <command>automake</command>, 
      <command>libtool</command>),
      <command>pkg-config</command>, GNU <command>make</command>.  To get
      detailed information about building these packages, see the documentation
      provided with the individual packages. On a Linux system, it's quite
      likely you'll have most of these installed already except for
      <command>pkg-config</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Next build and install GLib. Follow the
      steps of <literal>configure</literal>, <literal>make</literal>,
      <literal>make install</literal>. If you're lucky, this will all
      go smoothly, and you'll be ready
      to <link linkend="gegl-configuring">configure GEGL</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      If one of the <filename>configure</filename> scripts fails or running
      <command>make</command> fails, look closely at the error
      messages printed; these will often provide useful information
      as to what went wrong. When <filename>configure</filename>
      fails, extra information, such as errors that a test compilation
      ran into, is found in the file <filename>config.log</filename>.
      Looking at the last couple of hundred lines in this file will
      frequently make clear what went wrong.
