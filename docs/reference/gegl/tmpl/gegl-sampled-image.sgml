<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Image object with fixed resolution.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
This object describes what is usually thought of as normal image data.
SampledImage is the basic image data object. SampledImages are usually leaf
nodes in graphs and are used as inputs for Ops. An SampledImage sets its
ColorModel when it is created and has a width and height. SampledImage doesnt
actually have an operation to perform during apply, its output is basically
just itself.  SampledImages may be passed to any apply routine as the
destination buffer for an Op. This is how SampledImage are written to.  Since
SampledImages have a width and height, this determines their domain of
definition (have_rects).  During the evaluation of a graph, these have_rects
are propagated back up the graph towards the root. Depending on the ImageMgr,
image data for an SampledImage may be stored in different ways. This is left up
to the ImageMgr implementation.
