GeglEvalVisitor

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
A depth first visitor for evaluation.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
This visitor is setup by the #GeglEvalMgr to do the depth first pass of the
graph that does the actual evaluation of the ops. During this pass, the
EvalVisitor calls gegl_filter_validate_inputs(),
gegl_filter_validate_outputs(), and then gegl_filter_evaluate() for each
#GeglFilter it finds. gegl_filter_evaluate() is where each #GeglFilter does its
image processing. The validate methods do things like make sure the data is the
correct type, and if it is image data that it is prepared for the operation.
This might swap data in that was swapped out, or create buffers if they don't
exist yet. gegl_filter_validate_inputs() is also where any conversion of inputs
is done if the inputs don't match the needs of the #GeglFilter.
