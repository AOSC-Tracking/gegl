	* initial import of gegl gtk-docs. Makefile.am taken
	mostly from glib.  The args/parameters for most public/protected 
	functions are extracted from the gob/gil/c files. It would be 
	nice if we could also use gtk-doc for private functions as well.
	Ill try to provide a README for editing the gegl-sections.txt
	and the others. In the meantime if you know how to do gtk-docs 
	for glib/gtk etc it is about the same.
