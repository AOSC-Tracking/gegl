*GEGL* (Generic Graphics Library) is a graph based image processing framework.

With GEGL you chain together image processing operations represented by nodes
into a graph. GEGL provides such operations for loading and storing images,
adjusting colors, filtering in different ways, transforming and compositing images.

GEGL's programmer/user interface is a Directed Acyclic Graph of nodes. The DAG
expresses a processing chain of operations. A DAG, or any node in it, expresses
a composited and processed image.
