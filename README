You must use Gob 0.92.1 with gegl-0.0.2 and you should apply the patch
patch_for_gob-0.92.1 that is in this directory to the main.c of gob when you
build it. 

This has to do with a fix for circular headers created by gob in some cases,
but which isnt completely worked out yet (or which I dont understand how to
make gob do yet). 

There is some support for remaking generated .c and .h files automatically.
Look in src directory gegl/Makefile.am for rules at the bottom.

>make clean      only removes *.o's but not .h's or .c's or .gobs 
>make gobclean   removes the generated .c and .h files by gob, and leaves .gobs 
>make gobs       builds all generated .c and .h files from .gobs

Dependencies more or less work so if you edit a gob file, the make will pick up
that depend and rerun gob for you before compiling, but the very first build
seems to have trouble sometimes. (.deps files problem somehow). Just cd to
the gegl dir and do a make gobs for the first time. 

The testgegl file just creates some operators and runs them. There is a PrintOp
for debugging. See testgegl.c for details.
