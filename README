Building:

Gegl
-------------

When you type make in the top dir, the following should occur:

1)In the gegl subdir, libgegl gets made.

2)In the tools/testsuite subdir, a xUnit testing tool gets built. 

3)In the tests subdir, gegl unit tests get built and run, using the testsuite
tool built in step 1) above.

gil (generic image language)
-------------

This is the experimental new code generation tool.

When you type make in the gil dir, the following should occur:

1)In the gil/gil subdir, the (experimental) libgil is built.  This requires
flex/bison (or lex/yacc) installed somewhere. libgil is not used yet, but there
are some unit tests in gil/tests that show how to build simple expression
abstract syntax trees using it.

2)In gil/tests the unit tests for libgil are built and run. These use the
testsuite library built above for Gegl.
