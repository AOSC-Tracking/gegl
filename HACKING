The cvs version of Gegl is known to work with the following autotools:

- GNU autoconf 2.53
- GNU automake 1.4-p1
- GNU libtool 1.4
- GNU gettext 0.10.40

Some other versions of some tools may work, but the latest automake (eg 1.6)
does not work that well yet. I will try to keep autotools versions mostly in
sync with those needed by glib, gtk+, gimp.

To compile a CVS version of gegl on your system, you will need to take several
steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these steps at once by
running:

gegl> ./autogen.sh
   
Basically this does the following for you (but see autogen.sh for exactly what
is happening):

gegl> aclocal 
gegl> automake 
gegl> autoconf 
gegl> configure

Before running autogen.sh, make sure you have libtool in your path.  

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass options like
--prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options to autogen.sh and they
will be passed on to configure.
