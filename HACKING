The git version of GEGL is known to work with the following autotools:

- GNU autoconf 2.53
- GNU automake 1.7.5
- GNU libtool 1.4.3

Other versions of these tools probably work. Probably the tools that
work for current versions of glib will work for gegl as well. 

To compile a git version of GEGL on your system, you will need to take several
steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these steps at once by
running:

gegl> ./autogen.sh
   
Basically this does the following for you (but see autogen.sh for exactly what
is happening):

gegl> aclocal 
gegl> automake 
gegl> autoconf 
gegl> configure

The autogen in GEGL also uses ruby to generate some of the plug-ins, and
the API reference.

Before running autogen.sh, make sure you have libtool in your path.  

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you. If you wish to pass options 
to configure you can give those options to autogen.sh and they
will be passed on.
