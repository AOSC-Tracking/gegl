The cvs version of Gegl is known to work with the following autotools:

	- GNU autoconf 2.53
	- GNU automake 1.4-p1
	- GNU libtool 1.4
    - GNU gettext 0.10.38

Some other versions of some tools may work, but the latest automake (eg 1.6)
does not work for Gegl yet. I will try to keep autotools versions
mostly in sync with those needed by glib, gtk+, gimp.

To compile a CVS version of gegl on your system, you will need to take several
steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these steps at once by
running:

gegl> ./autogen.sh
   
Basically this does the following for you:

gegl> aclocal; automake; autoconf

The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you can run the
configure script to create all the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool in your
path.  

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass options like
--prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options to autogen.sh and they
will be passed on to configure.
