KNOWN BUGS
==========

*Nodes containing operations with infinite bounding boxes cannot be rendered
*Lots and lots of memory leaks
*Because the current XML serialization only supports a single tree (i.e. no islands in the graph or branching outputs),
	 saving the current graph will attempt to find an output to serialize. If multiple outputs exist in the graph,
	 only one will be saved and the output which is selected is undefined. This behavior will disappear when new 
	 serialization is available (ville is working on this)
