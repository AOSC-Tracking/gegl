Wed May  3 12:04:13 EDT 2000 calvinw@mindspring.com

	*fixed a problem with gegl/gegl-print-op.gil. Made it inherit from 
	gegl-single-src-op.gob. We need a statistics op, which would be 
	dest -less.  histogram ops, and similar ops will inherit from this. 	 

	*updated the PRINT macros in codegen/channel_data/float, u8, u16, 
	u16_4k files.

Wed Apr 12 17:03:42 PDT 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* check in for codegen

	* I have split Variable into two variables; Vector_Variable and
	Scaler_Variable. By doing this I have eliminated the first 
	argument to the pervious Varible (Scale/Vector). Everything else
	works the same.

	* I have change a bit the internals of parser.y. Having _c, _v, _ca
	be special strings caused some problem so I have changed _ to $. These
	special string tokens are added to varibles when ther are added to a 
	string so when I go to print the line (print_line) I know that I have
	to add certain sufixes to these varible depending on what line I am printing.

	* I have added the test_files/gegl-print-op.gil and
	test_files/gegl-fill-op.gil

Wed Apr 12 11:29:58 PDT 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* bug fix for my previous check in.

Wed Apr 12 10:39:26 PDT 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* check in for codegen

	* I have added printing option for codegen. You have to
	define PRINT (x) string in channel files, and you can now
	print color varibles.

	* I have added the notion of intorducing a varible into the 
	G_I_BLOCK without having to define it in the G_I_DECL block.
	The syntax is VARIBLE(Scaler/Vector name of varible name of type).
	The varible needs to be define as a Scaler or a Vector. If it is defined
	as a vector then [num] will be added to the varible. The number will depend
	on the varibles that the varible is associated with. For example, if it is set
	equal to a Pixel with 3 channels, then for the first channel it would be [0],
	second channel it would be [1] and for the third channel it would be [3].
	The name of the varible can be anything. With this there will be a file associated
	right now it is called file. In file the user can define any sufixes that he or she
	wants the varible to have. The syntax of this is
		type_name
		{
		datatype sufix
		...
		}
	When the lexer finds a type name (it is optional, you do not have to add a type name), it will
	look in the file file for the type name and find the sufix depending on the datatyupe.

	* I have updated the channel files with the PRINT string

	* I have changed test_files_test to test the two new features

	* I have added the file file
 
Mon Apr 10 13:43:06 EDT 2000 calvinw@mindspring.com

	* added a new line after each expantion of a vectorchan


Fri Mar 24 11:36:55 EST 2000 calvinw@mindspring.com 
	
	* codegen/test_files Updated most of the test_files
          test,test2-8.  

Thu Mar 23 17:53:28 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com
	
	* codegen/lexer.l I made sure that the extra
	\n, \t, '', thta can be left over from a 
	state token was removed.

Thu Mar 23 17:42:53 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen/parser.y in function get_sym. I fixed the
	crashing problem it had. I was using %d instead of %s
	when I created a new string.


Thu Mar 23 16:49:25 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com
	
	* codegen/parser.y. I have changed it so that
	%s_has_%s has now become its own varible, unlike 
	before when it lived of the color chan that it
	was associated with it.

Thu Mar 23 15:55:36 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen?parser.y. I have rm the varibles Pointer and
	PointerVecChan. It is now not possible to have any pointers
	in codegen.

Thu Mar 23 15:19:45 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen/parser.y I have made all PointerVecChab into
	Pointers in all the grammer except for on the declatation grammar. This solves the problem
	of * not showing up for varible that are not color varible.

Thu Mar 23 14:35:40 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	*codegen/parser.y changed the print_name function
	so that it sets the num varible to one.

Thu Mar 23 11:26:39 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com
	
	* codegen/lexer.l. Made sure that the lexer ate 
	up all the useless spaces that were left from
	reading the key words.

Wed Mar 22 18:07:30 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen. I have changed parer.y and lexer.l so
	that the data file can have any numbers of tabs 
	before the actual string.

Wed Mar 22 17:21:58 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen I have rm the necessity of haveing "" around
	the strings in the data files. I have changed both lexer.l
	and parser.y to complish this.

Wed Mar 22 16:10:12 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen/parser.y: I have fixed the problem with 
	do_op_three. The problem was the doing operations on
	different varibles with different number of elements.

Wed Mar 22 16:10:12 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen/parser.y: I have fixed the problem with 
	do_op_three. The problem was the doing operations on
	different varibles with different number of elements.


Wed Mar 22 14:28:56 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* codegen/parser.y I have changed it so that
	you can only preform operations if the .num
	varible is the same or that one of the variables
	is either a ZERO or a WP. The .num varible value
	for ZERO and WP is 0.

Wed Mar 22 10:23:14 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* fixed the problem of the varible has_alpha
	not showing up in the decleration

	* changed how datatype read the string in
	parser.y


Tue Mar 21 18:11:07 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* fixed the rpoblem with has_alpha. In the 
	get_sym function it would not recornise a has_alpha
	varible.

Tue Mar 21 17:03:19 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* fixed the indent problem with the 
	GENERIC_IMAGE_IMAGE_DATA_INIT

Tue Mar 21 16:23:10 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* Fixed the problem of always genercating _ha_alpha

	* Inited the value .inited

	* Fixed test file test2, test5

Tue Mar 21 14:28:32 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* I have added VectorCHan (color,alpha,has_alpha). This
	means that I have added the varible, and changed the
	init_data_image.

Tue Mar 21 10:24:30 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com
	
	* CHanged the arguments so that the last arg can be the
	input file. If this last arg is not present, the lexer will
	use stdin

	* rm print outs that was generated when reading the data file.

Tue Mar 21 09:44:35 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* in do_op_three for the case of OP_EQUAL, it
	was using the CHAN_MULT_STR instead of
	ROUND_STR

Mon Mar 20 17:04:58 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com
	
	* changed the lexer and the parser so that it will
	handle vectorchan that maybe has alpha.

	* i have updated the way codegen handles its data file
	so that it will read the file correctly

	* all the global char * varibles have now _STR at their end

	* the lexer has now a special state to read data files. the data
	file is processed by the lexer and parser.

Sat Mar 18 18:56:30 EST 2000 calvinw@mindspring.com

	* testgeglfile.c - more improvements.   Added back the tests for 
          the composite ops and the other point ops. 

Sat Mar 18 12:31:14 EST 2000 calvinw@mindspring.com

	* testgeglfile.c - some fixes and simplificatons. It
          was reading r,g,b,a in the wrong order, so it displays 
          correctly now. 

	* testgeglfile.c - command line args are just two equal 
          size RGBA source tiffs now: 
          >testgeglfile src1.tiff src2.tiff       

        * testgeglfile.c - removed extraneous iterator code, and so 
          dont really need get_current_rect in gegl-image-iterator constructor. 
          (However, the iterator class will need more design work for sure.) 

2000-03-16  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* gegl/gegl-image-iterator.gob: call get_current_rect in the
	constructor so that the scanline_data is initialized properly.

	* Made the token indent in lexer.l take \t

Thu Mar 16 12:09:30 PST 2000 caro@rhythm.com

	* This check in is for codegen
	* I have created a new structre called token_t and some new tokens 
	(COMPARE, MIN_MAX, ADD_SUB). These to new additions have allowed me to
	remove all the specific tokens for ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=,&,&&,|,||,MIN,MAX,++,--.
	The grammer look for the new tokens which is assoicated with the new struct
	so the grammar knows what to print. 
	* Fixed how parser.y reads the data file.

	* to run codegen type
	> codegen --channel-data-file CHANNEL_FILE_NAME --channel-names name,name,name
	For channel names it assumes that the last name is the alpha. If there is only
	one name it assumes that this one is alpha.
