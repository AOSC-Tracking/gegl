GEGL Performance tracking framework
===================================

This directory contains a framework to track performance development of a set
of tests over time. It requires make, ruby and ruby cairo bindings to work. The
framework is designed to be possible to drop in to existing software projects
and operate outside the projects own build system, it creates an internal clone
of the git repo - CAVEAT: it installs the tested project system wide.

Take a look at the top of Makefile for configuration of number of revisions to
test. And just type make to build, later invokations of make when the
repository has changed will generate tests for the new revisions. To re-run the
last revision type 'make retry'.

tests/ contains the tests being run for every revision and a makefile for
building the tests against an installed GEGL and testing all of them. Rename a
test to not end in .c to temporarily not test it.

make       # build tests
make clean # remove all temporary files
make check # run all tests with output values in std-out of the
           # form "\n@ test-name: 244.4".
