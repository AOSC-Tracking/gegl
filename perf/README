Performance tracking framework
------------------------------

This directory contains a simple framework to track performance development of
a set of GEGL tests over time. It requires ruby and ruby cairo bindings to
work.

Hopefully just typing make would trigger generation of a graph for the last
20 commits, edit the Makefile to change this behavior.
