GEGL Performance tracking framework
===================================

This directory contains a framework to track performance development of a set
of tests over time. It requires make, ruby and ruby cairo bindings to work.

Type "make" to update a report of the performance over the last N revisions,
where N is defined in the top of Makefile along with some other configuration
options.

An internal shallow clone of the master git repo is created for testing, when
testing revisions. When walking this git repo partial rebuilds are possible
like with git bisect.

tests/ contains the tests being run for every revision and a makefile for
building the tests against an installed GEGL and testing all of them. Adjust
the makefile to only build a few tests.

make       # build tests
make clean # remove all temporary files
make check # run all tests with output values in std-out of the
           # form "\n@ test-name: 244.4".
