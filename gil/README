See the unit tests in the gil/test directory for illustration of how libgil is
to be used. Currently there are just some parse trees that get built by hand.
Once those are little farther, I will hook this back up to yacc/lex for parsing
simple gil expressions.

The ast graph building code uses GObjects.
