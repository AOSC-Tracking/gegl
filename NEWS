Changes in GEGL 0.0.15
⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
 • Install headers for development of external operation plug-ins.
 • Added rowstride argument to gegl_buffer_set ()
 • Made it possible for sink operations to do cunkwise processing
   through GeglProcessor.
   when processed using a GeglProcessor.
 • constification of GeglRectangles and babl formats.
 • Build and dist fixes, general sanity improvements to APIs, plugged
   annoying buffer leaks.
