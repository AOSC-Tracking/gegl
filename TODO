=============================================================================

GEGL buffers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replace/augment the functionality provided by the linear gggl buffers with
tile based cached GEGL buffers. (done, based on the work from horizon)

Make GeglBuffer be an interface (or a container containing a TiledBackend,
LinearBackend GimpTileManagerBackend).

Pixel format negotation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a pass checking the input and output pixel representation capabilities of
connected nodes, and insert temporary proxies if they cannot agree on an agreed
exchange format. This will allow mixing various pixel representations,passing
rgb data to an operations expecting rgb would do an implicit conversion.

Right now all computation is done in 32bit floating point RGBA,. allowing
operations to have different pixelformat evalutae handlers,. and capabilities
that are reference tested against the floating point is important.

Optimized paths
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the ability to choose different implementations of the ops at runtime,
for insance using cairo/glitz/generated code. This should is closely related
to the pixel format negotiation.

GIMP plug-in proxy op.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A GEGL operation acting as a proxy to legacy gimp plug-ins will drag a lot
of the existing GIMP functionality along.

GEGL operation API freeze
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At some point the plug-in api for GEGL should be declared stable.

Multithreading
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make it possible to have multiple evaluations of the graph happening at the
same time. (both the way the visitor pattern is implemented, and the reference
counting for immediate freeing of buffers assumes a single thread of operation
at the moment.)
