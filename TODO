=============================================================================


A list of things to be done, roughly sorted in the order that might
make sense to do them.

Code cleanup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Coding style fixes (done)
 - usage of gobject macros (done)
 - removal of dead code, what should happen to gil and friends?, the
   ideas behind it are still valid, and would probably be faster than
   fallbacks in many cases.


Directory restructering
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A proposal for more directories in the source tree.

gegl/
    gegl/
        (files for lib init, and interacting with the graph)
        buffer/
            (the content that previously lived in a folder called image)
        operation/
            base classes for point ops, compositor, sources, sinks etc.
        operations-core/
            (_nop, _tee, _proxy, _null) internal operations, maybe gmodules.
    operations-base/ (gmodules)
        (porter-duff, blank, gaussian blur, brightness+contrast)
    docs/

API shakeup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Document the publically exported header of GEGL, create some minimal test
applications for reading images, doing some filtering and compositing as
well as writing the result back out. (done (outside the gegl module))


gggl buffers and simple operations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first step towards a working processing engine, could operate on a single
pixel representation using a linear gggl buffer, this should probably be
done using a floating point buffer. Using a single buffer type will postpone
the issue of colorspace negotation. At this point some simple will need
to be implemented to allow testing. (done (what was presented at the first LGM)


ROI calculations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making the nodes use have rects and need rects. As described in
http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/proceedings/graph/192161/p147-shantzis/
(done)


GEGL buffers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replace/augment the functionality provided by the linear gggl buffers with
tile based cached GEGL buffers.
(done, based on the work from horizon)


Pixelformat conversion library
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the code used in gggl's color format proxy code to a separate library
for reuse, this will provide the base for adding a pixel format negotiation
pass to the processing.
(done, is now in the CVS module babl)


Pixel format negotation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a pass checking the input and output pixel representation capabilities of
connected nodes, and insert temporary proxies if they cannot agree on an agreed
exchange format. This will allow mixing various pixel representations,passing
rgb data to an operations expecting rgb would do an implicit conversion.

Right now all computation is done in 32bit floating point RGBA,. allowing
operations to have different pixelformat evalutae handlers,. and capabilities
that are reference tested against the floating point is important.


gggl2GEGL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Migration of useful ops from gggl to GEGL.


cairo speedup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement alternate codepaths using cairo for 8bit versions, this will
eventually lead to the capability of using OpenGL through GEGL, cairo and glitz
to do hardware accelerated rendering of the projection for common usages.


GIMP plug-in operation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A GEGL operation acting as a proxy to legacy gimp plug-ins will drag a lot
of the existing GIMP functionality along.


GEGL operation API freeze
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At some point the plug-in api for GEGL should be declared stable.
