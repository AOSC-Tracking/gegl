=============================================================================

GEGL buffers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make GeglBuffer be an interface (or a use composition and allow for 
TiledBackend, LinearBackend GimpTileManagerBackend). This will make
integration with legacy GIMP code much easier.

Pixel format negotation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right now all computation is done in 32bit floating point RGBA,. allowing
operations to have different pixelformat evalutae handlers,. and capabilities
that are reference tested against the floating point is important.

Optimized paths
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the ability to choose different implementations of the ops at runtime,
for insance using cairo/glitz/generated code. This should is closely related
to the pixel format negotiation.

GIMP plug-in proxy op.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A GEGL operation acting as a proxy to legacy gimp plug-ins will drag a lot
of the existing GIMP functionality along.

GEGL operation API freeze
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At some point the plug-in api for GEGL should be declared stable.

Multithreading
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make it possible to have multiple evaluations of the graph happening at the
same time. (both the way the visitor pattern is implemented, and the reference
counting for immediate freeing of buffers assumes a single thread of operation
at the moment.)


Operations
==========

Caching operation
-----------------

Write an operations that maintains a sparse backing buffer the size of the HAVE
rect of the operations. Keeps rendered information, and keeps cached computations
as long as the properties have not changed.

An initial implementation of this should be designed to work directly on top of
source nodes only. Later a similar approach could be extended to work on subgraphs,
multiple such caches could be used as well, speeding up reevaluations at the expense
of extra tiles used for caching intermediate results.

Currently the meta loader contains it's own simplistic caching, per file loader caching
will be removed, to make the code needed for each importer node as simple as possible.
Thus the other file loaders should probably be hidden.

text source
-----------

Use pango for rendering, expose more parameters, perhaps look at integrating
the pango interface provided by GIMP?

SVG loader
----------

With basis in the text source (which uses cairo), create an operation that renders
to a buffer in a similar fashion using librsvg for the SVG parsing.
