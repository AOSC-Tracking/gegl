TODO:

  if the per_pixel/per_color code uses any of the alpha values we have
to do a big switch statement like in per_alpha.

  Fix up the headers output.

  Fix up capitalization in a couple of spots.

  Make the constants line up with the real gegl constants.

  Figure out how we tell GIL to generate multiple versions of the 
point processing functions

  Figure out how we code with specific colors (ie red, green, blue, cyan...)

  Make an actuall Gegl::N::Src::Op to derive the point op stuff from.

  Make the output actually compile.

  Automatic code indentation?
