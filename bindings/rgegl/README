A Ruby binding for GEGL, this binding binds all of the GEGL API and
includes a ruby layer of conveniences on top of the base binding.

To build the gegl extension for ruby type:

$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make

Samples contains some simple ruby scripts that demonstrate use of the binding.
These should be possible to run directly from the samples directory. To finally
install the GEGL extension type:

$ sudo make install

From time to time this binding might also include bindings of non-public
methods for evaluation purposes; these methods might disappear (or end up being
public) in future versions.
