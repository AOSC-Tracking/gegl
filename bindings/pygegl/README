This is a python binding for the gegl library. It is still in it's infancy,
much like gegl it self. 

Since gegl may still change it's API so this binding. Don't count on any
funcionality that is implemented now on still being there tomorrow ;-).

To compile and install this you need both GEGL(1) and babl(2) correctly
installed. This means checking out those packages from the SVN server,
compiling them, and installing. Since both of those software packages
are in development this binding can stop working at any moment.
