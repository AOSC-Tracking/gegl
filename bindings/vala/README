This is the vapi for GEGL. The GEGL API coverrage is not complete due
to API stability and maturity issues.

Currently, it is not yet possible to write GEGL Operation from
Vala. You can build a pipeline and process it.

See http://live.gnome.org/Vala for more details about Vala programming
language.
